    "point3": "If there’s excess production, Neos will sell 100% of the excess to the electricity market.",
    "point4": "Outside of solar production hours you will pay the market price of electricity, with a margin of €0.01 per KWh.",
    "point5": "You will need to pay tolls and costs associated with using the grid, estimated at €0.02 per KWh. ",
    "point6": "If you decide you do not want Neos as your retailer, there’s no commitment to stay with us, and you can choose another retailer at any point. ",
    "point7": "If you choose another retailer, we will send you every month the revenues generated by selling your solar energy into the electricity market, which is equivalent to the savings you would obtain if you were still with Neos. "
