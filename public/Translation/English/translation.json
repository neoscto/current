    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faqs": {
      "question0": "What is Neos?",
      "answer0": "<p>Neos is an electricity provider that enables customers in Spain to access electricity from solar panels situated in operational solar parks across the country. As our customer, you will benefit from solar energy without living in a sunny location or installing anything in your home or on your rooftop.</p>",
      "question1": "What is a Neos virtual solar installation?",
      "answer1": "<p>A Neos virtual solar installation refers to the full ownership of electricity produced by solar panels linked to your name, but installed in our solar parks. These parks are already connected to the country’s power grid, just like your home or business, so the connection is instant.</p><p> We've decided to call it \"virtual\" because there is no need for any <i>physical</i> setup at your location. Since solar energy is the cheapest source of electricity, you can save between 45% and 75% on your monthly electricity bills with our virtual solar installation and electricity provider services.</p>",
      "question2": "What are the advantages of buying Neos virtual solar installations instead of traditional rooftop panels?",
      "answer2": "<p>The main benefits of buying Neos virtual solar installations instead of rooftop panels are the following:</p> <br><ul><li><b>• Significantly Less Expensive:</b> Our virtual solar installations are 35% to 50% cheaper than traditional rooftop panels.</li><li><b>• No Installation Needed:</b> You don’t need any physical installations on your rooftop or inside your home. Neos brings solar energy directly to you, since you are already connected to the grid.</li><li><b>• No Rooftop Space Needed:</b> Whether you have a rooftop or not, Neos makes solar energy easily accessible for your home or business.</li><li><b>• No Sunny Weather Needed:</b> Whether you are located in a sunny area or not, Neos makes solar energy work perfectly for your home or business.</li><li><b>• Immediate Power Access:</b> With our solar parks already linked to the grid, start benefiting from solar power immediately, bypassing the long setup times of rooftop systems, which can take months.</li><li><b>• Maintenance-Free Solution:</b> Neos takes care of all maintenance and operations, offering optimal performance at no extra cost if you choose Neos as your provider, or at a minimal monthly fee of €1.5 per *kW of virtual solar installation otherwise, much lower than rooftop panel alternatives.</li><li><b>• Enhanced Energy Production:</b> Our strategically located and optimally managed solar parks produce on average 40% more electricity than conventional rooftop panels, maximizing your investment and environmental impact.</li><li><b>• Precise Allocation:</b> If your energy needs require 0.99 panels, we allocate exactly 0.99 panels, not 1, ensuring you pay only for what you need.</li></ul><br><p>*1 kW represents around 2.27 solar panels in our solar parks.</p>",
      "question3": "What are the advantages of choosing Neos as my electricity provider over conventional electricity providers?",
      "answer3": "<p>The main benefits of using Neos as your electricity provider instead of conventional electricity providers are the following:</p> <br><ul><li><b>• Lower Electricity Bills:</b> You will cut your monthly electricity bills by 45% to 75%, compared to what you'd normally pay with other electricity providers.</li><li><b>• Sustainable Lifestyle:</b> By opting for Neos, you will contribute to reducing carbon emissions with our clean, solar-generated electricity.</li><li><b>• Revenue from Unused Electricity:</b> You will earn revenue from the surplus electricity your virtual solar installation generates.</li><li><b>• Unmatched Flexibility:</b> You will benefit from the dual-source supply of solar energy and grid power at wholesale prices during non-sunny periods, ensuring you have access to energy at the best possible price at all times, day or night.</li></ul>",
      "question4": "How do I purchase a virtual solar installation from Neos?",
      "answer4": "<p>Simply estimate the number of solar panels that fit your needs by using our “Personalized Offer” calculator, which will ask for your CUPS, a code you can find in your electricity bill. If you don’t have it, you can simply use our slightly less precise “Standard Offer” calculator, which will only ask for the number of people in your house.</p><p>Once you like what you see, you can complete the purchase process, and we’ll handle your contract switching so you can receive electricity starting on the first day of next month.</p>",
      "question5": "What are the costs involved in Neos virtual solar installations?",
      "answer5": "<p>Prices range from €1,300 to €1,600 per *kW, depending on the installation capacity purchased. Additionally, these installations generate more electricity than comparable rooftop panels of the same capacity, leading to savings of up to 50% compared to equivalent rooftop solutions.</p><p>*1 kW represents around 2.27 solar panels in our solar parks. Yes, we also reserve fractional panels for our customers, so you don’t pay for more than you need; we don’t round up!</p>",
      "question6": "What installation size will meet my needs?",
      "answer6": "<p>Our optimized offer simulator asks just one question and instantly calculates the precise capacity you need, its cost, and your potential savings over 25 years. For a standard apartment housing 3 people, the simulator would recommend a 1.48 kW virtual solar installation, which represents around 3.36 panels. This costs €2,366 before VAT, a figure markedly lower than the 2.17 kW rooftop installation needed to generate the same electricity. With the applicable 21% VAT, the total comes to €2,863, compared to the €4,747 after VAT that this household would spend on the required 2.17 kW rooftop panels. In this scenario, opting for Neos as your provider would not only cut installation costs but also generate savings of around €21,159 in your electricity bills over 25 years, and savings of around €18,297 if we include the price of the virtual installation.</p>",
      "question7": "Can I still benefit from Neos if I don’t have a suitable rooftop for solar panels?",
      "answer7": "<p>Absolutely! Our model is designed for everyone, offering access to solar energy without the need for a personal rooftop. You can move houses and still receive electricity from those same panels, as long as you stay in Peninsular Spain.</p>",
      "question8": "How long does it take to connect my purchased installation to the grid?",
      "answer8": "<p>Your Neos virtual solar installation is already connected to the grid. Technically, you could receive electricity from it the minute you sign your contract with us, as opposed to months of waiting time when you buy rooftop panels. However, for logistical efficiency and regulatory purposes, your contract will become active on the first day of next month, so that’s when you will start receiving your electricity.</p>",
      "question9": "How long will my Neos installation last?",
      "answer9": "<p>Our solar panels are designed to last 25 years, just like rooftop panels, providing long-term renewable energy with minimal maintenance. Also, the maintenance is on us.</p>",
      "question10": "What are the benefits of choosing Neos as my electricity provider, on top of having a Neos installation?",
      "answer10": "<p>Alongside supplying you with electricity from the grid at no profit margin, Neos also gives you 100% of the revenue generated from the sale of your unused electricity and doesn’t charge you any maintenance fees for the panels responsible for your electricity generation for 25 years. This ensures you always get the best service possible, whether you're a small household or a large business. To make Neos your electricity provider, you simply pay a service fee: €6 monthly when your virtual solar installation is under 15 kW, suitable for most households; €12 monthly for installations exceeding 15 kW, typically for small and medium businesses; and €100 monthly for entities connected to high-voltage lines, which are usually the industrial companies.</p>",
      "question11": "Can I keep my current electricity provider and still use Neos?",
      "answer11": "<p>Yes, you have the flexibility to invest in a Neos installation while maintaining your existing electricity provider if desired. However, they will charge you a profit margin on the electricity they provide you, unlike Neos.</p>",
      "question12": "How does Neos price the electricity it provides?",
      "answer12": "<p>For a modest service fee, which is €6 per month for households, €12 per month for small and medium businesses, and €100 per month for industrial companies, you get to benefit from the following:</p> <br><ul><li><b>• When your installation is producing electricity,</b> you use it at €0 per *kWh consumed, plus necessary grid-related fees and taxes, thanks to owning the virtual solar installation.</li><li><b>• When your installation isn’t producing electricity,</b> you're billed for the electricity consumed at the wholesale rate plus necessary grid-related fees and taxes, without any profit margin for Neos, ensuring the lowest possible cost to you.</li></ul><br><p>*1 kWh (kilowatt-hour) measures the electricity consumption of operating a 1,000-watt appliance for 1 hour. For example, using a 100-watt light bulb for 10 hours consumes 1 kWh of energy.</p>",
      "question13": "Do I make money if my installation generates more electricity than I use?",
      "answer13": "<p>Yes. Neos takes care of feeding your excess electricity back into the grid, earning you revenue everyday. When you buy a Neos installation, there are two possible scenarios:</p> <br><ul><li><b>• Neos is your electricity provider:</b> Your monthly bills with us will further decrease thanks to your monthly revenue.</li><li><b>• Neos isn’t your electricity provider:</b> All the electricity produced by your virtual solar installation generates revenue for you, which will be deposited in your bank account on a monthly basis. Like with any income, you will be responsible for paying taxes on this amount at the end of the fiscal year.</li></ul>",
      "question14": "How long does it take to recover my investment in a Neos virtual solar installation?",
      "answer14": "<p>In the example of a 3-person household, when you buy a Neos installation, there are two possible scenarios:</p> <br><ul><li><b>• Neos is your electricity provider:</b> Your investment will have paid for itself in about 4.81 years, after which you still continue to save on your electricity bill for the 25-year lifespan of the panels linked to your name, making 7.39 times your initial investment.</li><li><b>• Neos isn’t your electricity provider:</b> Your investment will have paid for itself in about 6.56 years, after which you still continue to save on your electricity bill for the 25-year lifespan of the panels linked to your name, making 5.19 times your initial investment.</li></ul><br><p>On a side note, if you were to buy rooftop panels, your payback period would be about 14.03 years, and you would make 2.21 times your initial investment.</p>",
      "question15": "Does Neos take care of the operation and maintenance of my solar installation?",
      "answer15": "<p>When you buy a Neos installation, there are two possible scenarios:</p> <br><ul><li><b>• Neos is your electricity provider:</b> At no additional cost to you, Neos guarantees the optimal operation and maintenance of the solar parks hosting your installation for 25 years, ensuring your investment is secure and productive.</li><li><b>• Neos isn’t your electricity provider:</b> For the minimal maintenance fee of €1.5 per *kW of capacity per month, Neos guarantees the optimal operation and maintenance of the solar parks hosting your installation for 25 years, ensuring your investment is secure and productive.</li></ul><br><p>*1 kW represents around 2.27 solar panels in our solar parks. Yes, we also reserve fractional panels for our customers, so you don’t pay for more than you need; we don’t round up!</p>",
      "question16": "Can I monitor the performance of my solar installation?",
      "answer16": "<p>Yes, customers have access to our platform where they can track the performance of their installation online. Also, they can monitor their revenue, consumption, and spending at any time, as opposed to receiving an incomprehensible energy bill on a monthly basis.</p>",
      "question17": "Is there a difference between the electricity supplied by Neos from solar panels and from the grid? Will it affect how my appliances, like my phone, charge?",
      "answer17": "<p>Whether Neos powers your home with solar energy or taps into the grid during less sunny times, the electricity quality remains consistent. Your gadgets, like phones, charge just as efficiently, and your daily energy use stays the same—only greener.</p>",
      "question18": "What are the environmental benefits to adopting solar energy with Neos?",
      "answer18": "<p>A 3-person household that purchases a 1.48 kW virtual solar installation, which is equivalent to 3.36 solar panels, will save around 59.67 tons in CO2 emissions over the next 25 years, or 2.39 tons per year. To put this into perspective, the total CO2 savings are akin to the combined weight of nearly 14.92 adult male Asian elephants, or about 0.60 of such elephants each year.</p>",
      "question19": "How clean and renewable is the electricity supplied by Neos?",
      "answer19": "<p>The electricity you consume from your Neos installation when it’s productive comes exclusively from renewable solar energy, making you contribute to a greener future.</p><p>The electricity you consume from the power grid when your installation isn’t productive, like at nighttime, is sourced from the country’s energy mix at that specific time.</p>",
      "question20": "What if I want to leave Neos and switch energy providers?",
      "answer20": "<p>You're free to switch anytime—no minimum contract with Neos, no penalties for changing providers. Of course, your virtual solar installation will keep generating electricity and revenue for you since you have already paid for it. We ensure complete flexibility for your energy choices.</p>",
      "question21": "How do I get started with Neos?",
      "answer21": "<p>Starting is easy. Simply visit our website, estimate the number of solar panels that fit your needs, sign your contract, and pay for your extra awesome installation, all within 10 minutes. Welcome to the future of energy!</p>"
