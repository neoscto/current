                Introduction: We take your right to privacy seriously and want
                you to feel comfortable using our web site. This Privacy Policy
                deals with personally identifiable information (referred to as
                "Data" below) that may be collected by us on our site. By using
                this site, you consent to the collection and use of personal
                information as detailed in this Privacy Policy. Collection of
                Data: If you provide us with any personal or contact information
                in order to receive anything from us, we may collect and store
                that personal data. We do not automatically collect your
                personal e-mail address simply because you visit our site. Our
                contact page provides several e-mail addresses for your
                convenience when contacting us. Information collected on these
                forms is only used to correspond with you regarding your
                message. Any personal information you provide us with via this
                website, including your e-mail address, will never be sold or
                rented to any third party without your expressed permission.
                While we may track the volume of visitors on specific pages and
                download information from specific pages, these numbers are only
                used as a whole and without any personal information. This
                aggregate demographic information may be shared with our
                partners, but it is not linked to any personal information that
                can identify you or any visitor to our site. Like many web
                sites, we may also automatically receive general information
                that is contained in our server log files such as your IP
                address and cookie information. E-Commerce Transactions: When
                you place an order through our site, we collect your name,
                billing address (and shipping address if applicable), telephone
                number and e-mail address. We use this information to process
                and fulfill your order and to contact you about the order. The
                e-mail address collected here will not be sold or shared with
                any outside companies or third parties. This information will
                remain in our customer database to keep you up to date with our
                company. We also collect payment information, which may include
                your credit card number, card expiration date and CVV code. We
                use this information only to process and fulfill your order. We
                provide the use of an industry-standard secure sockets layer
                (SSL Certificate) when you place your order. All information is
                encrypted by the software during transmission to the payment
                gateway. Afterwards, all access to this information is limited
                and protected against unauthorized use. Information Requests: We
                also collect information that you provide us as a result of an
                information request. For example, if you request information on
                quote for a product or service or post a request for information
                about products or services, we collect the personal information
                that is provided to us. We may collect personal information such
                as name, e-mail address, city, state, country, other demographic
                information, and interests and preferences in these manners. We
                may also save and store an html version of the page in which you
                submitted a request for information for compliance purposes. For
                example, when a user submits their information requesting a
                quote/consultation about solar energy, we collect the user’s
                name, email address, phone number, address and other geographic
                information as well as information about your home and home
                energy usage. Cookies: Like many web sites, we may set and use
                cookies to enhance your user experience, such as retaining your
                personal settings. If advertising is present on our site, the
                companies serving the advertising do not have access to our
                cookies. Advertisements may set and access their own cookies on
                your computer and are subject to the privacy policies of those
                parties providing the advertisement. These companies usually use
                non-personally identifiable or anonymous codes to obtain
                information about your visits to our site. Use of Data: We may
                use Data collected (as outlined above) to customize and improve
                your user experience on this site. We will make every effort to
                ensure your Data is not provided to third parties unless: 1.
                provided for otherwise in this Privacy Policy; 2. we obtain your
                consent, such as when you choose to opt-in or opt-out to the
                sharing of Data; 3. a service provided on our site requires the
                interaction with, or is provided by, a third party - for
                example, in some instances we may partner with a third party to
                provide services such as newsletters, surveys to evaluate our
                products/services and company updates, and in such case, we may
                need to provide your contact information to said third parties;
                4. pursuant to legal process or law enforcement; 5. we find that
                your use of this site violates our this Policy, Terms of
                Service, other usage guidelines or as deemed reasonably
                necessary by us to protect our legal rights and/or property; or
                6. this site is purchased by a third party, whereby that third
                party will be able to use the Data in the same manner as set
                forth in this Privacy Policy. In addition, if you submit a
                product or service request through this site or otherwise submit
                an information request, we may share your personal information
                with our third party partners who can help fulfill your
                information/service request. Please note that these third
                parties with whom we share your information may (i) use such
                personal information for their own purposes (including
                commercial purposes) as set forth in their respective privacy
                policies, (ii) may disclose or dispose of your information to
                other third parties in the course of their own business, or
                (iii) may directly contact you (via email, direct marketing, or
                telemarketing) directly about your information/service requests
                through this website and/or their own products and services. In
                addition, you may be subject to the privacy policies of any
                third parties we share your information with pursuant to this
                policy. You may opt out of this use by contacting these third
                parties directly. Do Not Call List: You may have your telephone
