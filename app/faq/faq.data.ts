    question: "What is a Neos virtual solar installation?",
    answer:
      '<p>A Neos virtual solar installation refers to the full ownership of electricity produced by solar panels linked to your name, but installed in our solar parks. These parks are already connected to the country’s power grid, just like your home or business, so the connection is instant.</p><p> We\'ve decided to call it "virtual" because there is no need for any <i>physical</i> setup at your location. Since solar energy is the cheapest source of electricity, you can save between 45% and 75% on your monthly electricity bills with our virtual solar installation and electricity provider services.</p>',

    question:
      "What are the costs involved in Neos virtual solar installations?",
    answer:
      "<p>Prices range from €1,300 to €1,600 per *kW, depending on the installation capacity purchased. Additionally, these installations generate more electricity than comparable rooftop panels of the same capacity, leading to savings of up to 50% compared to equivalent rooftop solutions.</p><p>*1 kW represents around 2.27 solar panels in our solar parks. Yes, we also reserve fractional panels for our customers, so you don’t pay for more than you need; we don’t round up!</p>",

  {
    question: "What installation size will meet my needs?",
    answer:
      "<p>Our optimized offer simulator asks just one question and instantly calculates the precise capacity you need, its cost, and your potential savings over 25 years. For a standard apartment housing 3 people, the simulator would recommend a 1.48 kW virtual solar installation, which represents around 3.36 panels. This costs €2,366 before VAT, a figure markedly lower than the 2.17 kW rooftop installation needed to generate the same electricity. With the applicable 21% VAT, the total comes to €2,863, compared to the €4,747 after VAT that this household would spend on the required 2.17 kW rooftop panels. In this scenario, opting for Neos as your provider would not only cut installation costs but also generate savings of around €21,159 in your electricity bills over 25 years, and savings of around €18,297 if we include the price of the virtual installation.</p>",

    question:
      "Can I still benefit from Neos if I don’t have a suitable rooftop for solar panels?",
    answer:
      "<p>Absolutely! Our model is designed for everyone, offering access to solar energy without the need for a personal rooftop. You can move houses and still receive electricity from those same panels, as long as you stay in Peninsular Spain.</p>",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How long does it take to connect my purchased installation to the grid?",
    answer: "<p>Your Neos virtual solar installation is already connected to the grid. Technically, you could receive electricity from it the minute you sign your contract with us, as opposed to months of waiting time when you buy rooftop panels. However, for logistical efficiency and regulatory purposes, your contract will become active on the first day of next month, so that’s when you will start receiving your electricity.</p>",

  {
    question:
      "What are the benefits of choosing Neos as my electricity provider, on top of having a Neos installation?",
    answer:
      "<p>Alongside supplying you with electricity from the grid at no profit margin, Neos also gives you 100% of the revenue generated from the sale of your unused electricity and doesn’t charge you any maintenance fees for the panels responsible for your electricity generation for 25 years. This ensures you always get the best service possible, whether you're a small household or a large business. To make Neos your electricity provider, you simply pay a service fee: €6 monthly when your virtual solar installation is under 15 kW, suitable for most households; €12 monthly for installations exceeding 15 kW, typically for small and medium businesses; and €100 monthly for entities connected to high-voltage lines, which are usually the industrial companies.</p>",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I keep my current electricity provider and still use Neos?",
    answer:
      "<p>Yes, you have the flexibility to invest in a Neos installation while maintaining your existing electricity provider if desired. However, they will charge you a profit margin on the electricity they provide you, unlike Neos.</p>",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Neos price the electricity it provides?",
    answer:
      "<p>For a modest service fee, which is €6 per month for households, €12 per month for small and medium businesses, and €100 per month for industrial companies, you get to benefit from the following:</p> <br><ul><li><b>• When your installation is producing electricity,</b> you use it at €0 per *kWh consumed, plus necessary grid-related fees and taxes, thanks to owning the virtual solar installation.</li><li><b>• When your installation isn’t producing electricity,</b> you're billed for the electricity consumed at the wholesale rate plus necessary grid-related fees and taxes, without any profit margin for Neos, ensuring the lowest possible cost to you.</li></ul><br><p>*1 kWh (kilowatt-hour) measures the electricity consumption of operating a 1,000-watt appliance for 1 hour. For example, using a 100-watt light bulb for 10 hours consumes 1 kWh of energy.</p>",

  {
    question:
      "Do I make money if my installation generates more electricity than I use?",

      "<p>Yes. Neos takes care of feeding your excess electricity back into the grid, earning you revenue everyday. When you buy a Neos installation, there are two possible scenarios:</p> <br><ul><li><b>• Neos is your electricity provider:</b> Your monthly bills with us will further decrease thanks to your monthly revenue.</li><li><b>• Neos isn’t your electricity provider:</b> All the electricity produced by your virtual solar installation generates revenue for you, which will be deposited in your bank account on a monthly basis. Like with any income, you will be responsible for paying taxes on this amount at the end of the fiscal year.</li></ul><br>",

    question:
      "How long does it take to recover my investment in a Neos virtual solar installation?",
    answer:
      "<p>In the example of a 3-person household, when you buy a Neos installation, there are two possible scenarios:</p> <br><ul><li><b>• Neos is your electricity provider:</b> Your investment will have paid for itself in about 4.81 years, after which you still continue to save on your electricity bill for the 25-year lifespan of the panels linked to your name, making 7.39 times your initial investment.</li><li><b>• Neos isn’t your electricity provider:</b> Your investment will have paid for itself in about 6.56 years, after which you still continue to save on your electricity bill for the 25-year lifespan of the panels linked to your name, making 5.19 times your initial investment.</li></ul><br><p>On a side note, if you were to buy rooftop panels, your payback period would be about 14.03 years, and you would make 2.21 times your initial investment.</p>",
